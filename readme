Modifications to the acme editor, part of plan9port.
Build:
	Copy acme-l files into your plan9port directory, overwriting existing files.
	Rebuild the entire plan9port project.

Added keyboard shortcuts (based on http://plan9.bell-labs.com/sources/contrib/rminnich/):
	^b: left one char
	^f: right one char
	^d: delete next char
	^k: delete to end of line
	^l: redraw
	^n: move cursor to next line
	^p: move cursor to previous line
	^q: word backward
	^o: word forward
	^s: put
	^x: cut
	^c: copy
	^v: paste
	^z: undo

Added lisp style parenthesis highlighting:
	Execute "Lisp ON" to use parenthesis highlighting for that window.
	Execute "Lisp OFF" to disable it.

	Start acme with the "-p" arguement to use parenthesis highlighting for
	all windows by default.

Better font rendering (based on https://gist.github.com/jlouis/8638404).

GDB integration :
	All it does for now is highlight the appropriate line when GDB stops your program. Works when you change frames too.
	To use, put "adb" in your bin folder and add the following lines to the .gdbinit file in your home directory.

>	define hook-stop
>	where
>	shell adb "backtrace"
>	end
>
>	define hookpost-frame
>	shell adb "frame"
>	end
